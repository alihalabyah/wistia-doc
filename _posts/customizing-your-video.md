## The Customize Panel

{% post_image hashed_id: 'db0025a27de21064aa0bb2c5de505445643d1795', class: 'center' %}

After uploading a new video, the *customization* step gets it ready for the big
time. Open the customization panel by selecting *Customize* from under the
*Video Actions* menu.

{% post_image hashed_id: '1cb27f6a4d8a302de3f2e6fc72c44b2ff15236a1', class: 'center' %}

The customize panel slides out to reveal an array of different options for your
video. Let's walk through the customization options, along with some of the
*advanced level* tools for customization.

## Appearance

{% post_image hashed_id: 'ce7c8e288eadec78f049a63a4ed6660e09123dc9', width: 300, class: 'float_left' %}

The *Appearance* options are about getting your video looking *sharp*. 

Make sure the **thumbnail** is the one you want (we choose one for you from the middle
of the video by default, so you may want to [change it]('#changing-the-thumbnail')).

The **player color** should reflect your branding, to encourage more consistency in
your viewer's experience.

Finally - you can choose whether visitors to the video page will have the
option to **leave comments**.

## Changing the Thumbnail

Video still, poster image, first frame...we've heard all sorts of terms for the
image that appears when the page loads, before your viewer's begin watching. 
We call it the **thumbnail**.

By default, we select the middle frame of the video. But sometimes this can
catch the speaker in mid-sentence, or can reveal something about the content
you want to keep a secret!

To change it, select one of two options: **Upload a custom image** (one you
have carefully crafted) or **Use current frame** - which means you want the
frame that is currently showing in your video to the right.

Below is a quick screencast to show you the thumbnail update moves.

## Controls

{% post_image hashed_id: '27d9df9224bd47f11b58ca0ea3aebe6aeeda1ee5', class: 'float_right', width: 300 %}

The *Control* area includes the different control options you can add to your
video. Remove the play button, remove the full screen button, or make the video
autoplay.

## Social Bar

The *Social Bar* is our nickname for the group of social buttons that sit below 
the video and make it easy to share the video in social networks.

{% post_image hashed_id: '2ae01359e66b3db9d58c4b7ddd48a14d8ec4ed7e', class: 'float_right', width: 300 %}

The Social Bar has a bunch of options, from social networks like Twitter and 
Facebook to actions like *share stats* and *download*.

### Configuring the Social Bar Buttons

If you embed your video in a situation where content is shown in multiple
places, like a blog (where the video might be shown on the homepage *and* a
specific post page), you should use the *Buttons link to* option to make sure
all social bar buttons for that video point to the post page.

Select the *a specific page* option.

{% post_image hashed_id: 'f5c6a0a9dc0e3e428b2ced491dab0a78b5129f74', class: 'float_right', width: 300 %}

### Adding Your Logo

Adding your logo to the Social Bar is an easy way to link back to your homepage.

{% post_image hashed_id: 'ab9df82f7be1949f628c89e7003c2c30bbc70a76', class: 'float_right', width: 300 %}

Check the *Show logo on the right* checkbox. Upload your own logo (or use ours,
totally up to you!).

{{ "Logo images should have the max size of 100px by 20px, unless you want to crop it." | note }}

Finally, update the *Logo Link* to point to a page of your choosing.

## Call to Action

A call-to-action (or CTA) is a clickable message or image that appears
immediately after your video, and lets your viewers know what you want them to
do next.

{% post_image hashed_id: '09bfc5c29c924a7bbd1b08e6125f65b4054e3927', class: 'float_right', width: 300 %}

There are three types of CTAs:

* **Text:** add a quick, customizable message and link to direct your viewers.
* **Image:** use an image instead of a text link to direct viewers.
* **HTML:** write your own custom call-to-action *(advanced users only)*.

## Turnstile Email Gate

Turnstile is an easy email gate for your video content. It's great for lead
generation, and connects with [a bunch of great email providers]({{ '/turnstile' | post_url }}) to make
tracking new leads easy. [Read more on setting up Turnstile]({{ '/turnstile' | post_url }}).

{% post_image hashed_id: 'ea97dc0aae108a11c2f098b7d712b2a7d73ce210', class: 'float_right', width: 300 %}

There are three options for when you request viewer emails:

* Before they click play
* At the end of the video
* At a specific time in the video

### Integrate Turnstile with an Email Provider

Emails captured in the Turnstile email gate can be piped directly to an email
provider list, which makes it easy to follow-up with them.

To get started, click the *Setup an Email Provider* link. [Follow the
directions on the Turnstile doc page]({{ '/turnstile' | post_url }}) to get your provider fully setup and
linked.

## Captions

Captions and Transcripts are a must for the hearing impaired. They are also
useful for educational content, to make sure the audience is able to follow the
instructor. 

The transcript for a video can also help boost SEO ranking of your video content,
since the script of your video likely contains words related to your ranking terms.

[Read more about transcripts with Wistia]({{ '/transcripts' | post_url }}).

{% post_image hashed_id: '53bec864330fdd48fdfde29d74b46c817c3734d4', class: 'float_right', width: 300 %}

If your video already has captions, the Captions customize area will allow you
to *edit*, *download*, or *delete* the captions, as well as choose if you want
to include them by default.

{% post_image hashed_id: 'd3306d81104947e4c9a4a3954cf418053ef20c56', class: 'float_right', width: 300 %}

If your video does not have captions, you will instead be presented with the
option to order a transcript or upload your own captions SRT file.

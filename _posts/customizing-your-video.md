## The Customize Panel

{% post_image hashed_id: 'db0025a27de21064aa0bb2c5de505445643d1795', class: 'center' %}

After uploading a new video, the *customization* step gets it ready for the big
time. Open the customization panel by selecting *Customize* from under the
*Video Actions* menu.

The customize panel slides out to reveal an array of different options for your
video. Let's walk through the customization options, along with some of the
*advanced level* tools for customization.

## Appearance

The *Appearance* options are about getting your video looking *sharp*. 

Make sure the **thumbnail** is the one you want (we choose one for you from the middle
of the video by default, so you may want to [change it]('#changing-the-thumbnail')).

The **player color** should reflect your branding, to encourage more consistency in
your viewer's experience.

Finally - you can choose whether visitors to the video page will have the
option to **leave comments**.

## Changing the Thumbnail

Video still, poster image, first frame...we've heard all sorts of terms for the
image that appears when the page loads, before your viewer's begin watching. 
We call it the **thumbnail**.

By default, we select the middle frame of the video. But sometimes this can
catch the speaker in mid-sentence, or can reveal something about the content
you want to keep a secret!

To change it, select one of two options: **Upload a custom image** (one you
have carefully crafted) or **Use current frame** - which means you want the
frame that is currently showing in your video to the right.

Here's a quick screencast to show you the thumbnail update moves:

## Controls

The *Control* area includes the different control options you can add to your
video. Remove the play button, remove the full screen button, or make the video
autoplay.

## Social Bar

The *Social Bar* is our nickname for the group of social buttons that sit below 
the video and make it easy to share the video in social networks.

{% post_image hashed_id: '', class: 'center' %}

*Sorry for the tease, that isn't a video, just an example of a video embed with
the Social Bar turned on*

The Social Bar has a bunch of options, from social networks like Twitter and 
Facebook to actions like *share stats* and *download*.

### Configuring the Social Bar Buttons

If you embed your video in a situation where content is shown in multiple
places, like a blog (where the video might be shown on the homepage *and* a
specific post page), you should use the *Buttons link to* option to make sure
all social bar buttons for that video point to the post page.

Select the *a specific page* option.

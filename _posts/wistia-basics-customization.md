* *(0:30)* We're using Wordpress here, but you can use all sorts of website setups / CMS environments with Wistia.  Check out our [list of tested sites]({{ '/integration' | post_url }}).
* *(0:35)* Normally Alyce sets up the Wordpress blog post, and then tells me what size the video needs to be to fit within the post. We've also chosen a color we use for all our blog embeds.
* *(1:00)* All settings within the SuperEmbed builder apply to **embedded** video only, not video that plays from within your account.  It also doesn't update videos that are already embedded - if you have already embedded the video on your site, and want to change settings in the SuperEmbed builder, you'll need to re-embed the video.
* *(1:11)* When in doubt, use iframe.  API embed codes are useful for interacting with the video using our [Player API]({{ '/player-api' | post_url }}), and SEO embeds (which appear once you have a validated sitemap) are useful for SEO benefits.
* *(2:40)* In the post-roll menu, you can chose to use a text, image, or custom HTML post-roll.  You can also customize the overlay color to match your video!
* *(3:00)* Pre-roll email capture, or Turnstile, is easy-to-use and super powerful for gathering emails. To read more click [here](http://wistia.com/product/turnstile).
* *(3:30)* One feature we didn't cover in the SuperEmbed builder is [Transcripts]({{ '/transcripts' | post_url }}).
* *(4:20)* We had a bit too much espresso in the filming of this episode.
